		<h3><span>Project Name - </span>U.S.-Brazil Joint Initiative on Urban Sustainability JIUS</h3>
		<p>This is an innovative website to catalyze public-private partnerships for investment in sustainable 
		urban infrastructure and expanding markets for clean technology, products, and services. 
		The site was developed using the latest font end technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. 
		The site's design is responsive, so the website is available on mobile devices and tablet computers. 
		<br/>The project url is:<br/><a target="_blank" href="http://epa.gov/jius" title="JIUS">epa.gov/jius</a>

		<h3><span>Project Name - </span>RPM-web Redesign, National Cooperative Highway Research Program</h3>
		<p>NCHRP's online Research Performance Measure tool is a web application originally designed to assist state departments 
		of transportation in gauging research effectiveness.  The initial implementation of the tool was too complex; and therefore, 
		ICF was hired to redesign the website to attract more users to the system. My responsibilities included designing parts of 
		the database, implementing and configuring full text search using Apache Solr, implementing the authentication system, 
		and handling all deployments.

		<h3><span>Project Name - </span>SHRP C01 Web-application</h3><p>This application was designed for the Strategic Highway Research Program 2
		of the Transportation Research Board (TRB).  My role in the project as a developer was to build a highly interactive 
		web tool that educates researchers and transportation professionals about the new collaborative decision-making framework 
		that ICF designed for the TRB.  The web tool presents the framework and provides users with a diagnostic tool to determine
		how the framework can be used in specific projects. The ICF team developed the collaborative decision-making framework based 
		on interviews and workshops with major transportation stakeholders including the Department of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, 
		resource agencies, state transportation departments, 
		and metropolitan planning organizations.  ICF is also developing an IT tool to showcase the framework and educate practitioners for 
		direct implementation. My focus was on developing controllers, views, and models, as well as adding dynamic functionality to the 
		site's user interface.<br/>
		Technologies used include Ruby on Rails, MySQL database,SOLR search engine,jQuery.

		<p>The system was created for the NRC's Fitness-for-duty (FFD) program. The new system architecture was 
		designed by myself with guidance from the Technical Director. The updated version has several new features, which allow 
		drug & alcohol, fatigue, and annual report submissions. The redesigned submission system processes PDF forms by polling an inbox 
		folder on the server, and then cleans and normalizes the data before inserting it into a relational database. A new email feature notifies 
		users about potential submission issues. I also supported previous versions of this system and have a good 
		understanding of the overall system architecture. Using my prototype, several reports were developed. 
		My assistance with T-SQL queries to gather report data was a great opportunity to learn the FFD's database architecture. 
		Technologies used include SQL Server 2008, Java, Spring Framework, Jasper Reports, XML.</p></div>

			<h3><span>Project Name - </span>See More Products</h3>
					<h3>Project Overview</h3>
						<p>The objective of the "See More Products" project was to design a 
						new module for Exemplum's Flash demos which enables
						users to look at products related to the one they are currently viewing.
						</p>
					<h3>Technical details</h3>
						<p>The flash component calls an aspx page using action script. The 
						aspx class connects to a SQL-SERVER database and returns the related products
						using a stored procedure and a relationship algorithm. The aspx code writes
						the products to an XML document. The XML document is 
						consumed by the Flash Demo and the related products are displayed 
						to the user.
						</p>

			<h3>Project Overview</h3>
				<p>The Radford University Bridges and Pipelines project is a part of a larger 
				NSF S-STEM grant. During this semester long project, my teammates 
				and I worked closely with our client to build a web 
				application to assist selected faculty in keeping track of scholarship 
				recipients and their progress. The website authenticates users through 
				Radford University's central user database and verifies users are
				registered with the site before allowing access. The "administrator" 
				and "user" roles are differentiated in the system. The site 
				functionality also includes bulk adding of students from a word 
				document, editing, removing, and updating student progress. <br/>  <br/>
				For more information please visit:<br/>
			<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0849642" target="_blank" >Award Abstract - 
 Bridges and Pipelines to Success and Leadership in STEM</a>

				The Radford University Bridges website is currently hosted at:<br/>
				<a href="https://php.radford.edu/~sstem/login.php" target="_blank" >https://php.radford.edu/~sstem/login.php</a>
				</p>
			<h3>Technical details</h3>
				<p>The website is written using PHP. Validation on the page is done
				using an external JavaScript library and PHP. The page connects to
				an Oracle database which includes tables to support the user

				<h3><span>Project Name - </span>Administrative Logger for Faculty Annual Report System</h3>
			<h3>Project Overview</h3>
			<p>The Faculty Annual Report System is Radford University's effort 
			to reduce the paperwork required for yearly faculty 
			reports. Our team was tasked to create an administrative module to
			this application, and most importantly, create a modular and flexible
			logging system that can log information of various levels 
			in the application. This project assists the site administrator 
			in pinpointing errors and warnings in the system. The system should 
			allow the administrator to dial the log level up or down and define new error
			types. The administrator can then specify where and how 
			often the log files should be created. <br/><br/>
			 To learn more about this project please visit:<br/>
			 <a href="https://php.radford.edu/~spsc/wordpress/?page_id=7" target="_blank" >
				Small Project Support Center</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			<br/><br/>
			The site is currently being beta tested by professors and hosted at:<br/>
			 <a href="https://php.radford.edu/~spsc-far/faculty_interface/" target="_blank" >
				Faculty Interface of the Annual Report System </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</p>
			<h3>Technical details</h3>
			<p>The site uses an oracle database and is written in PHP, our administrative 
			system uses <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/log4php/" target="_blank">log4PHP</a> to assist with the logging functionality. When a new error
			type is created by the administrator it is stored in a database. All the 
			errors are then written to a flat file so the logger system remains functional even if 
			the database connection is lost. The system includes various error levels starting
			from TRACE_MESSAGE to a FATAL_ERROR. </p>
